I am a professor at the University of Montreal in the Departement of Political Science. My research is primarily focused on legislative institutions and comparative political development. I also have an interest in data science and machine learning. I am currently Director of the [*Big data analysis undergraduate certificate program*](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/) at the University of Montreal.

Parliamentary Voting Records of the Canadian Parliament
======
On this site, you will find the voting records of all Members of the Canadian House of Commons and Senate who served between 1867-2020. Part of these data were used in my book [*Lost on Division: Party Unity in the Canadian Parliament*](https://utorontopress.com/ca/lost-on-division-4) and in several other recent publications. 


Political Polarization and Text as Data
======
I also study political polarization with the [*Complex Data Lab*](https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io) at McGill University. You can find out more about this project [*here*](https://politicalpolarization.github.io).
